<div class="collapse">We procure most of our Fruits &amp; vegetable (includes leafy, and some  roots) directly from the  farmers. Hence they stay fresh and healthy.   We make sure other exotics available at only few locations reach us  within shortest time so that they can be delivered to you as fresh as  possible. We do purchases on daily basis and hence each day order is  delivered fresh! <br>
  <br>
We store the vegetable and fruits in a cool condition throughout the day  so that each delivery slot gets equally fresh vegetables and fruits. We do not keep any vegetable (except few which last longer) more than 24  hours. We either donate or distribute them in good condition before  they lose their freshness </div>

  <div>Why do you sometimes use punnets and plastic bags?</div>
</div>
<div class="AccordionPanelContent" style="height: 0px;">
<div class="collapse">
We only do this if it's essential to protect the food we're sending you. For example, mushrooms or tomatoes get squished without a punnet around them. Other produce, like green leaves, lose moisture very quickly, and need to be put into bags on the farm to prevent it from drying out.<br>
We don't make any assumptions, though. We'll always look at the variety before deciding to use plastic. For example, some of the more robust tomatoes / gourds are fine in paper bags.<br>
We are constantly looking at the way we package our produce and are introducing non-GM biodegradable plastic for all our punnets and bags. But, as of now we are using re-usable zippouches for packing fresh fruits and vegetables.

We have created a weekly vegetable and fruit box for a family of 4 keeping the balance diet and variety in mind. Instead of going through each item and adding it to cart you can directly order the veg/fruit box of the week.<br>
Easier to order through website or phone as it takes hardly 2 minutes to do the same!<br><br>

If you have dislikes of specific fruit or vegetable , you can mention the same while putting the order. We can replace them with any other vegetable or fruit without any additional cost.
