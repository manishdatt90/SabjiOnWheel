FAQs

<strong>1) Thumbnails not working?</strong>
- For Thumbnails, you have to select a picture as featured, screenshots available in the documentation link below. Use free plugin
"easy-add-thumbnail" for doing this automatically. You might also want to regenerate thumbnails 
for older posts or if you are switching from another theme, use free "regenerate thumbnails" plugin.

<strong>2) Featured Images in blog posts not showing?</strong>
- By default, the featured images are used only for the excerpt images on home and for sliders. This gives you the option 
to manually select images per post, for eg. if you want to display image after first paragraph (Above the Fold Algorithm). 
Settings available in Control Center -> Main Settings -> Show Featured Images. Turn it "ON" to auto display featured images on posts.
